## Iteration 2026-01-11 (first iteration)
- Completed: Story 1 - Create hello world script
- Steps verified:
  - [x] hello.sh file exists
  - [x] Script is executable (chmod +x)
  - [x] Running ./hello.sh prints 'Hello, RALPH!'
- Learned: Basic bash script structure with shebang (#!/bin/bash) and echo command
- Files changed: hello.sh (created), prd.json (updated passes/passed status)
- Notes: Simple hello world implementation. Script just echoes the required greeting.
