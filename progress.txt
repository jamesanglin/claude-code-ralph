# RALPH Progress Log

This file tracks learnings and progress across iterations.
Each Claude session should append its findings here.

---

## Iteration 2026-01-11 (first iteration)
- Completed: Story 1 - Create hello world script
- Steps verified:
  - [x] hello.sh file exists
  - [x] Script is executable (chmod +x)
  - [x] Running ./hello.sh prints 'Hello, RALPH!'
- Learned: Basic bash script structure with shebang (#!/bin/bash) and echo command
- Files changed: hello.sh (created), prd.json (updated passes/passed status)
- Notes: Simple hello world implementation. Script just echoes the required greeting.

## Iteration 2026-01-11 (second iteration)
- Completed: Story 2 - Add greeting function
- Steps verified:
  - [x] greet() function exists in hello.sh
  - [x] greet 'World' outputs 'Hello, World!'
  - [x] greet 'Alice' outputs 'Hello, Alice!'
- Learned: Bash functions use `local` for local variables, parameter accessed via $1. Source the script to make functions available in current shell for testing.
- Files changed: hello.sh (added greet function), prd.json (updated story 2 status)
- Notes: Added greet() function that takes a name parameter and outputs "Hello, {name}!". The original "Hello, RALPH!" echo is preserved at the end of the script.

## Iteration 2026-01-11 (third iteration)
- Completed: Story 3 - Add timestamp to greeting
- Steps verified:
  - [x] greet function includes timestamp in output
  - [x] Timestamp format is human-readable
  - [x] Running greet 'Test' shows current time
- Learned: Use bash `date` command with format string for human-readable timestamps. Format `"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"` gives ISO-style dates. Use command substitution `$(...)` to capture output into a variable.
- Files changed: hello.sh (modified greet function), prd.json (updated story 3 status)
- Notes: Modified greet() to include timestamp in format `Hello, {name}! [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`. Used local variable for timestamp to keep it clean.
